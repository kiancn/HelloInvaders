# Hello Invaders

This little game is an homage to the 'Space Invaders' genre, and my very first game.

This is a sneak peak video of Alpha 0.306:

And this is the last build of the game, before the project was shelved:

It's a plain Unity Game, no install needed. Just unzip it and play.

The demo brags 9 playable levels of increasing insanity. 

You gotta bring your own music.
